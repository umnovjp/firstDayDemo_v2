# firstDayDemo_v2
My second attempt to submit our first home work assignment. Application's links all function correctly. Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure. Application's CSS file is properly commented.
## Changes
I made sure all links are working, all images have alt text in case they do not load. Also, title is added.
